# Elliot's 2.11BSD Tools
These are tools that I made for 2.11BSD to run on my PiDP-11 emulator for the DEC PDP-11/70 system

The PiDP-11 is found here: [Obsolescence Guaranteed](https://obsolescence.wixsite.com/obsolescence/pidp-11) (Big thanks to Oscar for designing this masterpiece)

At the moment, I've created "curl", although maybe it should have a different name, as it's not readily compatible with modern curls. You should be able to work with some simple APIs with it though (No SSL)
